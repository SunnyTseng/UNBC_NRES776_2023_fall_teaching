# Happy Tuesday!

## Our schedule today

-   Announcement (5 min)

-   Key concepts for scientific data visualization (10 min)

-   Types of plots (30 min)

-   Wrap up (5 min)

## Announcements

-   Considering keep the video on (but you have absolute right for privacy)

-   For lab 1, add `set.seed(100)` to your script as one line, so that you will have the same random selection all the time (I will get the same value as you reported)

-   UNBC [Applied Analysis Hub](https://unbcaah.opened.ca/ta-office-hours/) workshop today!

-   How was your week?

### Recap

-   Concept of random variable

-   Different data types (continuous vs categorical)

-   Probability distributions

# How the data look like?

Using visualization to convey your research results is a key skill to have!

## Data visualization

>
>
> Data visualization is the representation of data through use of common graphics, such as charts, plots, infographics, and even animations.

-   table vs figures: human's brain is lazy

-   figures vs figures: use the figure best convey the message you want to elaborate

-   Make better use of colour, shape, transparent, line type, etc.

-   Concise, Accurate, Interpretable

-   Make them pretty! (selection of colour, size of the font, how to put several plots together, etc)

# Commonly used scientific plots

## Penguin data

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
glimpse(penguins)
```

-   3 categorical variables

-   4 continuous variables

## Histogram (1 continuous var.)

> A histogram is an approximate representation of the distribution of numberical data

```{r}
# Histogram example: flipper length by species
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = "identity") 
```

## Histogram (1 continuous var.)

Add one more **categorical** variable by **facet** (e.g., `sex`)

```{r}
# Histogram example: flipper length by gender
ggplot(data = penguins %>% drop_na(sex), aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~sex)
```

Add one more **categorical** variable by changing **colour** (e.g., `species`)

```{r}
# Histogram example: flipper length by species
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = species), alpha = 0.5, position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","darkorchid","cyan4"))
```

## Bar plot (1 categorical var.)

> A bar plot, or bar chart, is a graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip()
```

## Bar plot (1 categorical var.)

Add one more **categorical** variable using **colour** and **facet** at the same time (e.g., `species`)

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"), 
                    guide = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~species, ncol = 1) +
  coord_flip()
```

## Scatter plot (continuous x, continuous y)

## Box plot (categorical x, continuous y)

## You can always add variables by

-   point shape

-   point size (bubble plot)

-   colour

-   alpha

-   ...

## Get inspired by other people's work

## What we learned

-   Key concepts for scientific plot
-   Commonly used plot types (# of variables, type of variables)

## Wrap up

### Before we meet again

-   Submit your first lab on Moodle

### Next time

-   Thur. 8am lab, virtual on zoom
-   With your morning coffee/tea and relaxed mood
-   We will have some fun making plots
