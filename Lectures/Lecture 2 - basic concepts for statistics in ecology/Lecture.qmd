## Announcement {.smaller}

-   Sign up for discussion paper presentation by Sep. 14

-   Or I will do it for you ðŸ˜ƒ

-   Considering keep the video on (but you have absolute right for privacy)!

-   How was your week? smoke, school life?

## Why we need statistics?

Just for fun? For making life harder?

1.  How many moose are there in the research forest?

    -   Find all the moose, and count them, in the forest

2.  How many bird species are in mature forest vs clear cut?

    -   Stand there 24 hours, 365 days, and count all the bird species

3.  Dominant tree species in the Forest of the World?

4.  Caribou herd is healthier with supplemental feeding?

## Population is often...

### Too big, too many, and unrealistic to measure

-   How many moose are there in the research forest?

    -   Find all the moose, and count them, in the forest

    -   Mark-recapture **estimate**

-   How many bird species are in mature forest versus clear cut?

    -   Stand there 24 hours, 365 days, and count all the bird species

    -   Standardized point counts for **estimation** on both habitats

## We need estimates to ...

### Get more understanding about the population

-   The estimation is never "true"

-   But we can make sure the estimation is close enough to the true value

-   So that we can make actions in real life (conservation, medical purposes)

## Attributes

## What we learned

-   Population (parameters) vs Sample (statistics)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Different types of variables (continuous vs categorical)

-   Different types of random sampling

## Wrap up

### Before we meet again

-   Install R and RStudio

-   Play with RStudio to make sure it opens properly

### Next time

-   Thur. 8am lab, virtual on zoom
-   With your morning coffee and nice breakfast
-   And a relaxed mood
