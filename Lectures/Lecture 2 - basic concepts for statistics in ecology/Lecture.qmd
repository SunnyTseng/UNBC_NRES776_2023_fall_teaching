## Announcement {.smaller}

-   Sign up for discussion paper presentation by Sep. 14

-   Or I will do it for you ðŸ˜ƒ

-   Considering keep the video on (but you have absolute right for privacy)!

-   How was your week? smoke, school life?

# *There are three kinds of lies: 'Lies, damned lies, and statistics' -- Mark Twain.*

# Why we need statistics

To make our life harder?

## Population is often...

### Too big, too many, and unrealistic to measure

-   How many moose are there in the research forest?

    -   Find all the moose, and count them, in the forest

    -   Mark-recapture **estimate**

-   How many bird species are in mature forest versus clear cut?

    -   Stand there 24 hours, 365 days, and count all the bird species

    -   Standardized point counts for **estimation** on both habitats

## We need samples to ...

### Get more understanding about the population

> Statistics: a branch of mathematics dealing with collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation of (sampled) data

-   We can make sure the estimation is close enough to the true value

-   So that we can make actions in real life (conservation, medical purposes)

# Descriptive statistics

Summarize data into several numbers to provide you with an idea what the data look like.

## Attributes in Population vs Sample

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Population parameters**

(Greek letters)

-   mean ($\mu$)

-   standard deviation ($\sigma$)

-   variance ($\sigma^2$)

-   correlation coefficient ($\rho$)

-   number of elements ($N$)

-   ...
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Sample statistics**

(Roman letters)

-   mean ($\bar{x}$)

-   standard deviation ($s$)

-   variance ($s^2$)

-   correlation coefficient ($r$)

-   number of elements ($n$)

-   ...
:::
:::

## Mean

> Or average, refers to the central value of a set of numbers. The most common one is the Arthmetic mean

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n} = \frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^n x_i}{n}
$$

-   unit: the same as $x$

-   population parameter: $\mu$

## Median

> The number separating the higher half of a set of data from the lower half (50% of data above the median; 50% lower)

In the set of data `1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9`, the median is `5`

![](images/paste-51B239CC.png){fig-align="center" width="427"}

## Mode

> The value that appears with highest frequency

In the set of data `3, 4, 4, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8` , the mode value is `4`

- unit: the same as $x$

![](images/paste-9F5865CB.png)

## Variance

> Measures how far a set of numbers is spread out

$$
var(x) = S_x^2 = \frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n -1}
$$

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
1.  $(x_i - \bar{x})$: distance between each value and mean

2.  square: make everything positive

3.  sum: total distance square

4.  $n-1$: mean distance square
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/paste-A9F5C9EA.png)
:::
:::

-   unit: squared $x$

-   population parameter: $\sigma^2$

## Standard deviation

> Square root of variance (i.e., mean distance between each value and mean)

$$
S_x = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}}
$$

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   unit: the same as $x$

-   population parameter: $\sigma$

## Covariance

> A measure of how much two sets of data associated

$$
cov(x, y) = \frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{n-1}
$$

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   similar to the equation of the variance!

-   linear relationship -\> covariance

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   It may be difficult to tell the magnitude of cov between two sets of data because of the unit difference

:::
:::

## Correlation coefficient

> Standardized covariance

$$
r(x, y) = \frac{cov(x, y)}{S_x S_y} = \frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\Sigma_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\Sigma_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$

-   unit: no unit

-   population parameter: $\rho$

-   **value always between -1 to 1**

# Magic of random sampling

How to select samples from a population to make the estimates as close to the true value as possible

## Accuracy and precision

## Simple random sampling (i.i.d)

## Stratified sampling

## What we learned

-   Population (parameters) vs Sample (statistics)
-   Descriptive statistics
-   Different types of random sampling

## Wrap up

### Before we meet again

-   Install R and RStudio

-   Play with RStudio to make sure it opens properly

### Next time

-   Thur. 8am lab, virtual on zoom
-   With your morning coffee/tea and relaxed mood
