## Announcement {.smaller}

-   Sign up for discussion paper presentation by Sep. 14

-   Or I will do it for you ðŸ˜ƒ

-   Considering keep the video on (but you have absolute right for privacy)!

-   How was your week? smoke, school life?

# Why we need statistics?

## Population is often...

### Too big, too many, and unrealistic to measure

-   How many moose are there in the research forest?

    -   Find all the moose, and count them, in the forest

    -   Mark-recapture **estimate**

-   How many bird species are in mature forest versus clear cut?

    -   Stand there 24 hours, 365 days, and count all the bird species

    -   Standardized point counts for **estimation** on both habitats

## We need estimates to ...

### Get more understanding about the population

-   The estimation is never "true"

-   But we can make sure the estimation is close enough to the true value

-   So that we can make actions in real life (conservation, medical purposes)

## Attributes

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Population parameters**

(Greek letters)

-   mean ($\mu$)

-   standard deviation ($\sigma$)

-   variance ($\sigma^2$)

-   correlation coefficient ($\rho$)

-   number of elements ($N$)

-   ...

**Sample statistics**

(Roman letters)

-   mean ($\bar{x}$)

-   standard deviation ($s$)

-   variance ($s^2$)

-   correlation coefficient ($r$)

-   number of elements ($n$)

-   ...

# Descriptive statistics

## Mean 

## Standard deviation

## Variance 

## Correlation coefficient 

## Other commenly used descriptive statistics

-   Number of items in sample (n)

-   Most commonly occured value (mode)

-   Maximum value (max)

-   Minimum value (min)

-   Range of values (range)

# Magic of random sampling 

## Accuracy and precision 

## Simple random sampling (i.i.d)

## Systematic sampling

## Stratified sampling

## What we learned

-   Population (parameters) vs Sample (statistics)

```{=html}

-   Descriptive statistics

-   Different types of random sampling

## Wrap up

### Before we meet again

-   Install R and RStudio

-   Play with RStudio to make sure it opens properly

### Next time

-   Thur. 8am lab, virtual on zoom
-   With your morning coffee/tea and relaxed mood
