# Our first (official) lecture!

## Announcement {.smaller}

-   Considering keep the video on (but you have absolute right for privacy)!

-   UNBC [Applied Analysis Hub](https://unbcaah.opened.ca/ta-office-hours/)

-   Workshop: use R to create study area map (Sep. 19th 15:00 - 16:30pm)

-   How was your week? smoke, school life?

# *There are three kinds of lies: 'Lies, damned lies, and statistics' -- Mark Twain.*

# Why we need statistics

To make our life harder?

## Population is often...

### Too big, too many, and unrealistic to measure

-   How many moose are there in the research forest?

    -   Find all the moose, and count them, in the forest

    -   Mark-recapture **estimate**

-   How many bird species are in mature forest versus clear cut?

    -   Stand there 24 hours, 365 days, and count all the bird species

    -   Standardized point counts for **estimation** on both habitats

## We need samples to ...

### Get more understanding about the population

> Statistics: a branch of mathematics dealing with collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation of (sampled) data

-   We can make sure the estimation is close enough to the true value

-   So that we can make actions in real life (conservation, medical purposes)

# Descriptive statistics

Summarize data into several numbers to provide you with an idea what the data look like.

## Attributes in Population vs Sample

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Population parameters**

(Greek letters)

-   mean ($\mu$)

-   standard deviation ($\sigma$)

-   variance ($\sigma^2$)

-   correlation coefficient ($\rho$)

-   number of elements ($N$)

-   ...
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Sample statistics**

(Roman letters)

-   mean ($\bar{x}$)

-   standard deviation ($s$)

-   variance ($s^2$)

-   correlation coefficient ($r$)

-   number of elements ($n$)

-   ...
:::
:::

## Mean

> Or average, refers to the central value of a set of numbers. The most common one is the Arthmetic mean

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n} = \frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^n x_i}{n}
$$

-   unit: the same as $x$

-   population parameter: $\mu$

## Median

> The number separating the higher half of a set of data from the lower half (50% of data above the median; 50% lower)

In the set of data `1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9`, the median is `5`

![](images/paste-51B239CC.png){fig-align="center" width="427"}

## Mode

> The value that appears with highest frequency

In the set of data `3, 4, 4, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8` , the mode value is `4`

- unit: the same as $x$

![](images/paste-9F5865CB.png)

## Variance

> Measures how far a set of numbers is spread out

$$
var(x) = S_x^2 = \frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n -1}
$$

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
1.  $(x_i - \bar{x})$: distance between each value and mean

2.  square: make everything positive

3.  sum: total distance square

4.  $n-1$: mean distance square
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/paste-A9F5C9EA.png)
:::
:::

-   unit: squared $x$

-   population parameter: $\sigma^2$

## Standard deviation

> Square root of variance (i.e., mean distance between each value and mean)

$$
S_x = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}}
$$

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   unit: the same as $x$

-   population parameter: $\sigma$

## Covariance

> A measure of how much two sets of data associated

$$
cov(x, y) = \frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{n-1}
$$

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   similar to the equation of the variance!

-   linear relationship -\> covariance

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   It may be difficult to tell the magnitude of cov between two sets of data because of the unit difference
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/paste-2D57ED78.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## Correlation coefficient

> Standardized covariance

$$
r(x, y) = \frac{cov(x, y)}{S_x S_y} = \frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\Sigma_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\Sigma_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$

-   unit: no unit

-   population parameter: $\rho$

-   **value always between -1 to 1**

# Magic of sampling

How to select samples from a population to make the sampling statistics as close to the population parameters?

## Accuracy and precision

> Accuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the true value. Precision refers to how close measurements of the same item are to each other.

![](https://www.antarcticglaciers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/precision_accuracy.png){fig-align="center"}

We need a sampling method that is both accurate and precise.

## Simple random sampling (i.i.d)

> A subset of a statistical population in which each each unit has an equal probability of being chosen. Each unit has independent identical distribution (i.i.d)

## Stratified sampling

> Stratification is the process of dividing members of the population into homogeneous subgroups before sampling.

## When to use what?

### Simple random sampling

When the population is relatively homogeneous or uniform

-   Select 20 sites from a forest, regardless of their forest type

-   Select 20 recordings from a day, regardless of the time of recording

-   Select 40 trees from a plot, regardless of their species

### Stratified sampling

When a population\'s characteristics are diverse and you want to ensure that every characteristic is properly represented in the sample.

-   Select 20 sites out of 4 forest types

-   Select 20 recordings from morning and night

-   Select 40 trees with equal number of trees of each species

## What we learned

-   Population (parameters) vs Sample (statistics)
-   Descriptive statistics
-   Different types of random sampling

## Wrap up

### Before we meet again

-   Install R ([Window](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/), [Mac](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

-   Play with RStudio to make sure it opens properly

-   [Sign up](https://forms.gle/6nk5isVMbBJCmvfZ8) for discussion paper presentation by Sep. 14

-   Or I will do it for you ðŸ˜ƒ

### Next time
