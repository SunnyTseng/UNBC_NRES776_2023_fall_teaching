# *Statistics is the grammar of science -- Karl Pearson.*

# Understand your data type

## Random variable

> Random variable: a variable whose value has probability associated to each value of the set.

e.g., age of a student in the class $X$

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
# load library rcompanion
library(rcompanion)
  
# create data vector
x= c(rnorm(n = 30, mean = 26, sd = 1.2))
  
# draw plot
plotNormalHistogram(x, prob = TRUE,
                      main = "Age of our class",
                      length = 1000 )
```

<div>

The probability of $X$ being a certain value:

$$
P(X = 26) = 0.3
$$

Random variable can be either continuous or categorical.

## Continuous vs categorical

# Probability distribution

The knowledge about distribution is essential to understand how modelling works!

## Normal distribution

> Or Gaussian distribution. A bell-shaped curve, the tails on both side are continuous to infinity, Symmetric.

## Z-distribution

> Standardized normal distribution, that is $N(0, 1^2)$. To transform ANY $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ to $N(0, 1^2)$:

## t-distribution

> A distribution of estimates sampling from normally distributed population when the sample size is small (n \< 30).

## F-distribution

> Use most notably in Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), which we will cover later in this course

## $\chi^2$ -distribution

> chi-squared test for goodness of fit of an observed distribution to a theoretical one

## What we learned

-   Definition and types of random variables
-   Common distributions for a random variable

## Wrap up

### Before we meet again

-   Review the two lectures

-   Review and practice with the R coding

-   Play with your own dataset

### Next time

-   Tue. 12:30, virtual on zoom
-   Have a wonderful weekend
