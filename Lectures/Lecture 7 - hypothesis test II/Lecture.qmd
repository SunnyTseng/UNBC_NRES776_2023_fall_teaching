## Population and sample

If we are interested in the height of students in UNBC.

![](images/Group-13.jpg){fig-align="center" width="624"}

-   How much can we trust the values we get from the sample?

-   Is $\bar{x}$ close enough to $\mu$?

-   Is $s_x$ some how represents $\sigma$?

## Mathematicians did a fun experiment

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### To answer whether we can trust $\bar{x}$

1.  From a population, a group of people...

2.  Randomly selected $n$ people (sample 1), calculate $\bar{x_1}$

3.  Put everyone back

4.  Randomly selected $n$ people (sample 2), calculate $\bar{x_2}$

5.  Put everyone back

6.  ...(repeat above, say 1000 times)

### Take a look at the $\bar{x}$s

-   The distribution of $\bar{x}$ may look like this

-   This is called **sampling distribution**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
#make this example reproducible
set.seed(0)

#create random variable with sample size of 1000 that is uniformally distributed
data <- runif(n=1000, min=150, max=200)

sample5 <- c()

#take 1,000 random samples of size n=5
n = 1000
for (i in 1:n){
sample5[i] = mean(sample(data, 50, replace=TRUE))
}

#create histogram to visualize sampling distribution of sample means
hist(sample5, col ='steelblue', main = " ", xlab='Height (cm)')

```

## Sampling distribution

> A probability distribution of a sample statistic that is obtained through repeated sampling of a specific population.

-   What's special about this sampling distribution?

-   Take a look at the $n$, our sample size

## Central limit theorem (CLT)

> When $n \geq 30$, the sampling means are normally distributed with $mean(\bar{x}) = \mu$, and $sd(\bar{x}) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, no matter what distribution that population has.

-   Central limit theorem is important and cool! Because...somehow, sampling distribution is almost always normally distributed, when $n$ is large.

### Standard error (SE)

> Standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution: $sd(\bar{x}) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

-   SE describes standard deviation of sampling distribution

-   SE means how wide spread is the 1000, or whatever many, sample means

-   SE decreases when $n$ increases; SE is large when $\sigma$ is large

## Now what?

-   Based on CLT, imagine that you have a sampling distribution $N(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n})$
-   And you sample from population again, you get $\bar{x}_{new}$ as its mean
-   $\bar{x}_{new}$ has $68\%$ probability to locate within $\mu \pm \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, that is $\mu \pm \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$
-   We can have a sense about population just by **ONE sample**!

## Confidence interval (CI)

> An interval that has $C\%$ probability containing true mean. Where $C = 1-\alpha$, is called confidence level, and $\alpha$ is called significance level.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   $\mu$ has **68%** probability within $\bar{x} \pm \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$

-   $\mu$ has **95%** probability within $\bar{x} \pm \frac{2s}{\sqrt{n}}$

-   $\mu$ has **99%** probability within $\bar{x} \pm \frac{3s}{\sqrt{n}}$

$$
CI = \bar{x} \pm t_{(\frac{\alpha}{2}, n-1)} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

-   We need to use t-distribution here because $n$ might be smaller than 30, and only if assuming the population itself is normally distributed.

## JPRF black bear

-   We measured the weight from 25 black bears in JPRF forest, and got their averaged weight as 400 kg, with standard deviation 20 kg.

-   Find the confidence interval for $\mu$, with $90\%$ confidence interval.

$$
n = 25, \bar{x} = 400, s = 40, \alpha = 0.1
$$

$$
Upper = \bar{x} + t_{0.05, 24} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 413.7
$$

$$
Lower = \bar{x} - t_{0.05, 24} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 386.3
$$

-   Based on our sample, we have $90\%$ confidence that the weight of a black bear in JPRF forest is between 386.3 to 413.7 kg.

## What we learned

-   Concept of sampling distribution
-   Central limit theorem tells us
    -   mean of the sampling distribution is an unbiased estimate of the population mean

    -   sd of the sampling distribution is called standard error
-   Standard error is not the same thing as standard deviation
-   We can get a confidence interval about population mean, just by one sample!
-   And keep in mind... the topic we learned in each lecture can be a course by itself

## Wrap up

### Before we meet again

-   Review the two lectures (important)

-   Review and practice with the R coding (also important)

-   Maybe use what we learned to explore your own data

### Next time

-   Tue. 12:30, virtual on zoom
-   Have a wonderful, relaxing, gull-like weekend
