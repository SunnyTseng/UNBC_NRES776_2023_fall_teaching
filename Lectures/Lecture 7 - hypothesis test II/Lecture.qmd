## Hypothesis test: two hypotheses

> Hypothesis test is a decision making process. We use it to translate a question of interest into a mathematical form. Then, we can make inference to population parameters.

-   You can formulate question into two mutual exclusive hypotheses:

    -   $H_0$: **Null hypothesis** (equal to, no effect, the same as, etc.)

    -   $H_a$: **Alternative hypothesis** (not equal to, different, etc.)

+----------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

-   We usually use $=$ in null hypothesis

-   Always use **parameters** (e.g., $\mu, \beta$) when writing out hypothesis

## Put everything together

1.  **Set up** $H_0$ **and** $H_a$
    -   e.g., $H_0: \mu = 180, H_a: \mu \neq 180$
2.  **Determine statistical significance level** $\alpha$
    -   usually be $0.05$ or $0.1$
3.  **Calculate the test statistics**
    -   If doing t-test, calculate $t_{statistics} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$

    -   If doing z-test, calculate $z_{statistics} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$
4.  **Find the p-value corresponded to the test statistics**
    -   p-value $=P(t \ge t_{statistics})$
    -   The probability of a value larger than test statistics

![](https://www.simplypsychology.org/wp-content/uploads/p-value.jpg){.absolute top="150" right="0" width="514"}

5.  **Compare** $\alpha$ **and p-value and draw conclusion**
    -   $p-value \ge \alpha$: fail to reject $H_o$

    -   $p-value < \alpha$: reject $H_0$

## JPRF black bear example

The JPRF manager claim that the population mean ($\mu$) of the black bear weight is 390 kg. Is this claim valid?

You, as a researcher, came to the forest and measured the weight from 25 black bears in JPRF forest, and got their averaged weight as 400 kg, with standard deviation **40** kg.

## JPRF black bear example

### 1. Set up $H_0$ and $H_a$

-   $H_0:\mu = 390$: the population mean of the black bear weight is 390 kg.

-   $H_a: \mu \neq 390$, the population mean of the black bear weight is not 390 kg.

### 2. Determine statistical significance level $\alpha$

-   We set the significance level $\alpha$ as 0.1

### 3. Calculate the test statistics

-   We are using t-statistics (because $n$ is small)

-   $t_{statistics} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{400 - 390}{40/\sqrt{25}} = 1.25$

## JPRF black bear example

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### 4. Find the p-value for test statistics

-   Using t-table, or R, or [online calculator](https://www.socscistatistics.com/pvalues/tdistribution.aspx)

-   Find the p-value for $t_{statistics} = 1.25$

    -   $df = n-1 = 24$

    -   two-tailed

-   $p-value = 0.22$

### 5. Compare $\alpha$ and p-value and draw conclusion
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/paste-5181F6DF.png)
:::
:::

-   $p-value > \alpha$, we fail to reject $H_0$.

-   Thus, we support the statement that the population mean of the black bear weight is equal to 390.

### 4.1 Find the critical statistics for $\alpha$

-   Using t-table, or R, or [online calculator](https://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/criticalvalues/default.aspx)

-   Find the $t_{critical}$ corresponded with $\alpha$

    -   $df = n-1 = 24$

    -   two-tailed

-   $t_{ctitical} = 1.711$

### 5.1 Compare $t_{statistics}$ and $t_{critical}$ and draw conclusion
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/paste-5181F6DF.png)
:::
:::

-   $t_{statistics} \le t_{critical}$, we fail to reject $H_0$.

-   Thus, we support the statement that the population mean of the black bear weight is equal to 390.

### 4.2 Find upper and lower limits

-   Using t-table, or R, or [online calculator](https://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/criticalvalues/default.aspx)

-   Find the $t_{critical}$ corresponded with $\alpha = 0.1$

    -   $df = n-1 = 24$

    -   two-tailed

-   $t_{ctitical} = 1.711$

-   $CI = \bar{x} \pm t_{critical} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 400 \pm 1.711 * 40/\sqrt{25} = 400 \pm 13.68$

### 5.2 Compare CI with $\mu$ and draw conclusion
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/paste-5181F6DF.png)
:::
:::

-   $\mu = 390$, which is within (386.3, 413.7), we fail to reject $H_0$.

-   Thus, we support the statement that the population mean of the black bear weight is equal to 390.

## Three ways to do hypothesis test

### A. compare p-value and $\alpha$

-   $p-value \ge \alpha$: fail to reject $H_0$

-   $p-value < \alpha$: reject $H_0$

### B. compare statistical value vs critical value

-   $t_{statistics} < t_{criticle}$: fail to reject $H_0$

-   $t_{statistics} \ge t_{criticle}$: reject $H_0$

### C. compare confidence interval

-   If the confidence interval covers $\mu$: fail to reject $H_0$

-   Otherwise: reject $H_0$

## One-tailed or two-tailed test?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### How to tell

-   Based on the research question

-   If the $H_0$ is written with $=$, then it's a two-tailed test

-   If the $H_0$ is written with $>$ or $<$, then it's a one-tailed test

### So what

-   This would influence how you look up your p-value

:::

-   Two-tailed test, when looking up the p-value, the probability needs to multiply by 2.

-   Two-tailed test, when looking up the $t_{critical}$, the probability is $\alpha/2$.

## **Gum thickness:** a two-tailed t-test

### The story

A manufacturer claims that the thickness of the spearmint gum it produces is 7.5 one-hundredths.

. . .

A quality control specialist regularly checks this claim. On one production run, he took a random sample of *n* = 10 pieces of gum and measured their thickness.

. . .

He obtained:

![](images/paste-9A58F1C5.png)

. . .

$$
n = 10, \bar{x} = 7.55, s = 0.1027, \alpha = 0.05
$$

Base on this sample, is the claim from the manufacturer valid?

## **Gum thickness**

### To solve this

. . .

### 1. Set up $H_0$ and $H_a$

-   $H_0:\mu = 7.5$: the mean of the spearmint gum thickness equals 7.5

-   $H_a: \mu \neq 7.5$, the mean of the spearmint gum thickness doesn't equal 7.5

### 2. Determine statistical significance level $\alpha$

-   We set the significance level $\alpha$ as 0.05

### 3. Calculate the test statistics

-   We are using t-statistics (because $n$ is small)

-   $t_{statistics} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{7.55 - 7.5}{0.1027/\sqrt{10}} = 1.54$

## **Gum thickness**

### To solve this

### 4. Find the p-value for test statistics

-   Using t-table, or R, or [online calculator](https://www.socscistatistics.com/pvalues/tdistribution.aspx)

-   Find the p-value for $t_{statistics} = 1.54$

    -   $df = n-1 = 9$

    -   **two-tailed**

-   $p-value = 0.158$

### 5. Compare $\alpha$ and p-value and draw conclusion

-   $p-value > \alpha$, we fail to reject $H_0$.

-   Thus, we support the statement that the mean of the spearmint gum thickness equals 7.5.

## **Gum thickness**

### Can you try the CI method?

$$
n = 10, \bar{x} = 7.55, s = 0.1027, \alpha = 0.05
$$

$$
CI = \bar{x} \pm t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}, n-1} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
CI = 7.55 \pm 2.262 * \frac{0.1027}{\sqrt{10}} = (7.476, 7.623)
$$

-   5 mins oral presentation "NRES776\_*firstname_lastname*\_project_1.ppt"

### Content

-   Research background (e.g., efficient audio analysis methods is needed in avian study)

-   Hypothesis (e.g., frequency features in audio can be used to identify sound sources)

-   Methods (e.g., use logistic modelling, a type of GMM, to identify significant features, or variables)

-   Potential contribution (i.e., how your results be helpful for science/public/or your audience)

-   They doesn't need to be in this order

## Project I

### Statistical methods

-   Multiple linear regression

-   Generalized linear models

-   Mixed-effect models

-   Multivariate analysis

-   If none of these can be applied to your data, or you are not sure, come have a chat with me or Lisa. The goal of this project is to help you practice the methods we learned in this course, which doesn't cover all analysis methods.

### Encouraged 

-   Data visualization would be fun

-   Funding proposal for a lay audience

-   Feel free to be creative

## Wrap up

### Before we meet again

-   Review the two lectures (important)

-   Review and practice with the R coding (also important)

-   Maybe use what we learned to explore your own data

### Next time

-   Oct. 19 \@ 8 am lab, project I presentation, **In Person**, I will be in Prince George 🎠
