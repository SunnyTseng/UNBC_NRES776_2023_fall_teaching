# Happy Tuesday!

## Our schedule today

-   Announcements (5 min)

-   What's is hypothesis test? (15 min)

-   Steps of conducting hypothesis test (25 min)

-   Wrap up (5 min)

## Announcements

-   How was your week?

### Recap

-   Sampling distribution - distribution of the sample means

-   We can use **one sample** to calculate sample mean and standard error

-   And base on these, we can get confidence interval about **true mean**

## JPRF black bear

-   We measured the weight from 25 black bears in JPRF forest, and got their averaged weight as 400 kg, with standard deviation **40** kg.

-   Now the manager asked you to find the confidence interval for population mean ($\mu$) of the black bear weight, with $90\%$ confidence interval.

$$
n = 25, \bar{x} = 400, s = 40, \alpha = 0.1
$$

$$
Upper = \bar{x} + t_{0.05, 24} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 413.7
$$

$$
Lower = \bar{x} - t_{0.05, 24} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 386.3
$$

-   Based on our sample, we have $90\%$ confidence that the **population mean of a black bear weight** in JPRF forest is between 386.3 to 413.7 kg.

## Hypothesis test: hypotheses

> Hypothesis test is a decision making process. We use it to translate a question of interest into a mathematical form. Then, we can make inference to population parameters.

-   You can formulate question into two mutual exclusive hypotheses:

    -   $H_0$: **Null hypothesis** (equal to, no effect, the same as, etc.)

    -   $H_a$: **Alternative hypothesis** (not equal to, different, etc.)

+----------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

-   We usually use $=$ in null hypothesis

-   Always use **parameters** (e.g., $\mu, \beta$) when writing out hypothesis

## Hypothesis test: $\alpha$ level

> Significance level, or type I error, is the probability that you reject null hypothesis $H_0$ when it's true. Usually set as $0.05$ or $0.1$.

-   For example, it's the probability for making a **wrong** decision "the mean of students' height is not equal to 180", when $\mu = 180$.

-   It's a type of error, so we want it to be small

## Put everything together

## Is the claim valid or not?

### The story

A manufacturer claims that the thickness of the spearmint gum it produces is 7.5 one-hundredths of an inch, with $95\%$ confidence.

. . .

A quality control specialist regularly checks this claim. On one production run, he took a random sample of *n* = 10 pieces of gum and measured their thickness.

. . .

He obtained:

. . .

Base on this sample, is the claim from the manufacturer valid?

## Is the claim valid or not?

### To solve this

. . .

There are two possible outcomes:

-   The mean of the spearmint gum thickness equals 7.5 ($\mu = 7.5$)

-   The mean of the spearmint gum thickness doesn't equal 7.5 ($\mu \neq 7.5$)

. . .

$$
n = 10, \bar{x} = 7.55, s = 0.1027, \alpha = 0.05
$$

$$
CI = \bar{x} \pm t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}, n-1} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 413.7
$$

$$
CI = 7.55 \pm 1.8336 * \frac{0.1027}{\sqrt{10}} = (7.49, 7.61)
$$

-   Based on our sample, we have $90\%$ confidence that the **po**

A company claim that their product has 450 mm. How can we trust that? A checker 50 bottles, found the mean is about 448, standard deviation 20. Is the claim valid?

Statement 1: The volume equals 450 mm.

Statement 2: The volume is not equal to 450 mm.

95% CI is (432, 459), which covers the 450, we say that the fail to reject Result 1. The statement that "volume equals 450" is supported with confidence level 0.05!

## Hypothesis test

> A method of statistical inference used to decide whether the data at hand sufficiently support a particular hypothesis. Hypothesis testing allows us to make probabilistic statements about population parameters.

Component:

## Two hypothesis

> Mutually exclusive statements.
