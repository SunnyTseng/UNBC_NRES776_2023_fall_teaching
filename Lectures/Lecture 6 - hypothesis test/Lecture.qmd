# Happy Tuesday!

## Our schedule today

-   Announcements (5 min)

-   What's is hypothesis test? (15 min)

-   Steps of conducting hypothesis test (25 min)

-   Wrap up (5 min)

## Announcements

-   How was your week?

### Recap

-   Sampling distribution - distribution of the sample means

-   We can use **one sample** to calculate sample mean and standard error

-   And base on these, we can get confidence interval about **true mean**

## JPRF black bear

-   We measured the weight from 25 black bears in JPRF forest, and got their averaged weight as 400 kg, with standard deviation **40** kg.

-   Now the manager asked you to find the confidence interval for population mean ($\mu$) of the black bear weight, with $90\%$ confidence interval.

$$
n = 25, \bar{x} = 400, s = 40, \alpha = 0.1
$$

$$
Upper = \bar{x} + t_{0.05, 24} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 413.7
$$

$$
Lower = \bar{x} - t_{0.05, 24} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 386.3
$$

-   Based on our sample, we have $90\%$ confidence that the **population mean of a black bear weight** in JPRF forest is between 386.3 to 413.7 kg.

## Hypothesis test: hypotheses

> Hypothesis test is a decision making process. We use it to translate a question of interest into a mathematical form. Then, we can make inference to population parameters.

-   You can formulate question into two mutual exclusive hypotheses:

    -   $H_0$: **Null hypothesis** (equal to, no effect, the same as, etc.)

    -   $H_a$: **Alternative hypothesis** (not equal to, different, etc.)

|                                                    | $\mu_{floss} = \mu_{no floss}$                              | $\mu_{floss} \neq \mu_{no floss}$                        |
+----------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

-   We usually use $=$ in null hypothesis

-   Always use **parameters** (e.g., $\mu, \beta$) when writing out hypothesis

## Hypothesis test: type I error $\alpha$

> Significance level, or type I error, is the probability that you reject null hypothesis $H_0$ when it's true. Usually set as $0.05$ or $0.1$.

-   For example, it's the probability for making a **wrong** decision "*the mean of students' height is not equal to 180*", when $\mu = 180$.

-   It's a type of error, so we want it to be small

![](images/paste-B0562533.png)

## Hypothesis test: type II error $\beta$

> Type II error is the probability that you fail to reject null hypothesis $H_0$ when it's actually not true.

-   For example, it's the probability for making a **wrong** decision "*the mean of students' height in UNBC is the same as UBC*", when $\mu_{unbc} \neq \mu_{ubc}$

-   This is a type of error, so we want it to be small as well

-   $1-\beta$ is called **Power**, the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when $H_0$ is not true. We want it high

![](images/paste-3295A826.png){width="678"}

## Hypothesis test: result interpretation

-   Reject $H_0$, the sample supports the statement from $H_a$

-   Fail to reject $H_0$, the sample supports the statement from $H_0$

    -   $\mu_{floss} = \mu_{no floss}$, or

    -   actually $\mu_{floss} \neq \mu_{no floss}$ but data are too sparse to demonstrate a difference

![](https://www.scribbr.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/type-i-and-ii-error-2.png)

## Hypothesis test: things to keep in mind

-   Failing to reject $H_0$ is not the same as accepting $H_0$

-   We can only gain evidence for a hypothesis, but not possible to prove a hypothesis

## What is $\alpha$ actually?

## Put everything together

1.  Set up $H_0$ and $H_a$
    -   e.g., $H_0: \mu = 180, H_a: \mu \neq 180$
2.  Determine statistical significance level $\alpha$
    -   usually be $0.05$ or $0.1$
3.  Calculate the test statistics with sampled data
    -   If doing t-test, calculate $t_{statistics} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$

    -   If doing z-test, calculate $z_{statistics} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$
4.  Find the p-value corresponded to the test statistics
    -   p-value $=P(t \ge t_{statistics})$
    -   The probability of a value larger than test statistics

![](https://www.simplypsychology.org/wp-content/uploads/p-value.jpg){.absolute top="150" right="0" width="514"}

5.  Compare $\alpha$ and p-value and draw conclusion
    -   $p-value \ge \alpha$: fail to reject $H_o$

    -   $p-value < \alpha$: reject $H_0$

## JPRF black bear example

The JPRF manager claim that the population mean ($\mu$) of the black bear weight is 390 kg. Is this claim valid?

You, as a researcher, came to the forest and measured the weight from 25 black bears in JPRF forest, and got their averaged weight as 400 kg, with standard deviation **40** kg.

## JPRF black bear example

### 1. Set up $H_0$ and $H_a$

-   $H_0:\mu = 390$: the population mean of the black bear weight is 390 kg.

-   $H_a: \mu \neq 390$, the population mean of the black bear weight is not 390 kg.

### 2. Determine statistical significance level $\alpha$

-   We set the significance level $\alpha$ as 0.1

### 3. Calculate the test statistics with sampled data

-   We are using t-statistics (because $n$ is small)

-   $t_{statistics} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} = 0.79$

## JPRF black bear example

### 4. Find the p-value

-   Find the p-value for $0.79$ on the t-distribution (df = 24)

-   $p-value = 0.43$

### 5. Compare $\alpha$ and p-value and draw conclusion

-   $p-value > \alpha$, we fail to reject $H_0$.

-   Thus, we support that the population mean of the black bear weight is equal to 390.

## Three ways to do hypothesis test

### A. compare p-value and $\alpha$

-   $p-value \ge \alpha$: fail to reject $H_0$

-   $p-value < \alpha$: reject $H_0$

### B. compare statistical value vs critical value

-   $t_{statistics} < t_{criticle}$: fail to reject $H_0$

-   $t_{statistics} \ge t_{criticle}$: reject $H_0$

### C. compare confidence interval

-   If the confidence interval covers $\mu$: fail to reject $H_0$

-   Otherwise: reject $H_0$

## One-tailed or two-tailed test?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### How to tell

-   Based on the research question

-   If the $H_0$ is written with $=$, then it's a two-tailed test

-   If the $H_0$ is written with $>$ or $<$, then it's a one-tailed test

### So what

-   This would influence how you look up your p-value

-   When doing two-tailed test, the probability is $\alpha/2$ when looking up critical values

## An example of a two-tailed t-test

### The story

A manufacturer claims that the thickness of the spearmint gum it produces is 7.5 one-hundredths of an inch, with $95\%$ confidence.

. . .

A quality control specialist regularly checks this claim. On one production run, he took a random sample of *n* = 10 pieces of gum and measured their thickness.

. . .

He obtained:

![](images/paste-9A58F1C5.png)

. . .

Base on this sample, is the claim from the manufacturer valid?

## Is the claim valid or not?

### To solve this

. . .

There are two possible outcomes:

-   The mean of the spearmint gum thickness equals 7.5 ($\mu = 7.5$)

-   The mean of the spearmint gum thickness doesn't equal 7.5 ($\mu \neq 7.5$)

. . .

$$
n = 10, \bar{x} = 7.55, s = 0.1027, \alpha = 0.05
$$

$$
CI = \bar{x} \pm t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}, n-1} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 413.7
$$

$$
CI = 7.55 \pm 1.8336 * \frac{0.1027}{\sqrt{10}} = (7.49, 7.61)
$$

-   Based on our sample, we have $90\%$ confidence that the **po**

A company claim that their product has 450 mm. How can we trust that? A checker 50 bottles, found the mean is about 448, standard deviation 20. Is the claim valid?

Statement 1: The volume equals 450 mm.

Statement 2: The volume is not equal to 450 mm.

95% CI is (432, 459), which covers the 450, we say that the fail to reject Result 1. The statement that "volume equals 450" is supported with confidence level 0.05!

## What we learned

-   We can list null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis for research questions
-   We set the confidence level that we want to test on
-   We calculate the test to support, or not support, certain hypothesis
-   Make conclusion
