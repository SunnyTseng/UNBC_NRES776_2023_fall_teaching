### Recap

-   Sampling distribution - distribution of the sample means

-   We can use **one sample** to calculate sample mean and standard error

-   And base on these, we can get confidence interval about **true mean**

-   And I made some mistakes in last week lecture JPRF bear slide... let's take a look at it again.

## JPRF black bear

-   We measured the weight from 25 black bears in JPRF forest, and got their averaged weight as 400 kg, with standard deviation **40** kg.

-   Now the manager asked you to find the confidence interval for population mean ($\mu$) of the black bear weight, with $90\%$ confidence interval.

$$
n = 25, \bar{x} = 400, s = 40, \alpha = 0.1
$$

$$
Upper = \bar{x} + t_{0.05, 24} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 400 + 1.711 * \frac{40}{\sqrt{25}}= 413.7
$$

$$
Lower = \bar{x} - t_{0.05, 24} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 400 - 1.711 * \frac{40}{\sqrt{25}}= 386.3
$$

-   Based on our sample, we have $90\%$ confidence that the **population mean of a black bear weight** in JPRF forest is between 386.3 to 413.7 kg.

## Hypothesis test: two hypotheses

> Hypothesis test is a decision making process. We use it to translate a question of interest into a mathematical form. Then, we can make inference to population parameters.

-   You can formulate question into two mutual exclusive hypotheses:

    -   $H_0$: **Null hypothesis** (equal to, no effect, the same as, etc.)

    -   $H_a$: **Alternative hypothesis** (not equal to, different, etc.)

+----------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Research question                                  | $H_0$                                                       | $H_a$                                                    |
+====================================================+=============================================================+==========================================================+
| Does tooth flossing affect the number of cavities? | Tooth flossing has **no effect** on the number of cavities. | Tooth flossing has **effect** on the number of cavities. |
|                                                    |                                                             |                                                          |
|                                                    | $\mu_{floss} = \mu_{no floss}$                              | $\mu_{floss} \neq \mu_{no floss}$                        |
+----------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

-   We usually use $=$ in null hypothesis

-   Always use **parameters** (e.g., $\mu, \beta$) when writing out hypothesis

## Hypothesis test: result interpretation

-   Reject $H_0$, the sample supports the statement from $H_a$

-   Fail to reject $H_0$, the sample supports the statement from $H_0$

    -   $\mu_{floss} = \mu_{no floss}$, or

    -   actually $\mu_{floss} \neq \mu_{no floss}$ but data are too sparse to demonstrate a difference

## Hypothesis test: type I error $\alpha$

> Significance level, or type I error, is the probability that you reject null hypothesis $H_0$ when it's true. Usually set as $0.05$ (5%) or $0.1$ (10%).

-   For example, it's the probability for making a **wrong** decision "*the mean of students' height is not equal to 180*", when $\mu = 180$.

![](images/paste-B0562533.png){fig-align="center" width="752"}

## Hypothesis test: type II error $\beta$

> Type II error is the probability that you fail to reject null hypothesis $H_0$ when it's actually not true.

-   For example, it's the probability for making a **wrong** decision "*the mean of students' height in UNBC is the same as UBC*", when $\mu_{unbc} \neq \mu_{ubc}$

-   $1-\beta$ is called **Power**, the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when $H_0$ is not true.

![](images/paste-3295A826.png){fig-align="center" width="678"}

## More about $\alpha$

### What is it exactly?

> Definition (again): the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis $H_0$ when it's true. In other words, we have 5% or 10% risk of making type I error.

-   Think about this...

-   If we want to test whether $\mu = 180$. How "far away" from this value that our sample mean needs to be, that we say it's not equal?

-   181? 185? or 200?

-   I can make my "rule" like this:

    -   If $170 \le \bar{x} \le 190$, then I make decision to support $\mu = 180$

    -   If $\bar{x} \le 170$ or $\bar{x} \ge 190$, then I make decision to support $\mu \neq 180$

-   Sounds great!

## More about $\alpha$

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### What is it exactly?

-   But, the rule that I set may have "risk" of making type I error

-   that is $P(\bar{x} \le 170) + P(\bar{x} \ge 190)$ when $\mu = 180$

-   The shaded area

-   So... we can make the rules (e.g., set our threshold) to calculate the "risk" we have
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/paste-F95900D8.png){fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

-   Vice versa, we can choose how much "risk" we can take, and find the rules (e.g., thresholds) accordingly.

-   Here is where $\alpha$ comes from! We set our risk at $5\%$ of making type I error and use this to decide our testing rules, to see which statement that our sample supports.

## More about $\alpha$

### Why don't we just set it super low?

-   Yes you can

-   It becomes very hard to reject $H_0$

-   You might not making mistake in rejecting $H_0$ when it's true (i.e., you avoid making type I error)

-   But at the same time, you might not reject $H_0$ when it's not true (i.e., you risk in making more type II error $\beta$)

-   (Advanced) one way you can reduce the type I error and increase the power of the test is by increasing your sample size.

-   (Advance) there is a way to calculate the sample size you need to keep low $\alpha$ while maintaining high power ($1-\beta$)

## Hypothesis test: things to keep in mind

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
 

-   Failing to reject $H_0$ is not the same as accepting $H_0$

-   We can only gain evidence for a hypothesis, but not possible to prove a hypothesis

-   Maybe there is an effect ($H_0$ is not true), just that your sample doesn't show it

-   Be specific, and put measurable things in the hypothesis test (e.g., \# of cavities, species abundance in different forest treatment)

-   ...

## Put everything together

1.  **Set up** $H_0$ **and** $H_a$
    -   e.g., $H_0: \mu = 180, H_a: \mu \neq 180$
2.  **Determine statistical significance level** $\alpha$
    -   usually be $0.05$ or $0.1$
3.  **Calculate the test statistics**
    -   If doing t-test, calculate $t_{statistics} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$

    -   If doing z-test, calculate $z_{statistics} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$
4.  **Find the p-value corresponded to the test statistics**
    -   p-value $=P(t \ge t_{statistics})$
    -   The probability of a value larger than test statistics

![](https://www.simplypsychology.org/wp-content/uploads/p-value.jpg){.absolute top="150" right="0" width="514"}

5.  **Compare** $\alpha$ **and p-value and draw conclusion**
    -   $p-value \ge \alpha$: fail to reject $H_o$

    -   $p-value < \alpha$: reject $H_0$

## JPRF black bear example

The JPRF manager claim that the population mean ($\mu$) of the black bear weight is 390 kg. Is this claim valid?

You, as a researcher, came to the forest and measured the weight from 25 black bears in JPRF forest, and got their averaged weight as 400 kg, with standard deviation **40** kg.

## JPRF black bear example

### 1. Set up $H_0$ and $H_a$

-   $H_0:\mu = 390$: the population mean of the black bear weight is 390 kg.

-   $H_a: \mu \neq 390$, the population mean of the black bear weight is not 390 kg.

### 2. Determine statistical significance level $\alpha$

-   We set the significance level $\alpha$ as 0.1

### 3. Calculate the test statistics

-   We are using t-statistics (because $n$ is small)

-   $t_{statistics} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{400 - 390}{40/\sqrt{25}} = 1.25$

## JPRF black bear example

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### 4. Find the p-value for test statistics

-   Using t-table, or R, or [online calculator](https://www.socscistatistics.com/pvalues/tdistribution.aspx)

-   Find the p-value for $t_{statistics} = 1.25$

    -   $df = n-1 = 24$

    -   two-tailed

-   $p-value = 0.22$

### 5. Compare $\alpha$ and p-value and draw conclusion
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/paste-5181F6DF.png)
:::
:::

-   $p-value > \alpha$, we fail to reject $H_0$.

-   Thus, we support the statement that the population mean of the black bear weight is equal to 390.

## JPRF black bear example (other methods)

### 4.1 Find the critical statistics for $\alpha$

-   Using t-table, or R, or [online calculator](https://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/criticalvalues/default.aspx)

-   Find the $t_{critical}$ corresponded with $\alpha$

    -   $df = n-1 = 24$

    -   two-tailed

-   $t_{ctitical} = 1.711$

### 5.1 Compare $t_{statistics}$ and $t_{critical}$ and draw conclusion
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/paste-5181F6DF.png)
:::
:::

-   $t_{statistics} \le t_{critical}$, we fail to reject $H_0$.

-   Thus, we support the statement that the population mean of the black bear weight is equal to 390.

### 4.2 Find upper and lower limits

-   Using t-table, or R, or [online calculator](https://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/criticalvalues/default.aspx)

-   Find the $t_{critical}$ corresponded with $\alpha = 0.1$

    -   $df = n-1 = 24$

    -   two-tailed

-   $t_{ctitical} = 1.711$

-   $CI = \bar{x} \pm t_{critical} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 400 \pm 1.711 * 40/\sqrt{25} = 400 \pm 13.68$

### 5.2 Compare CI with $\mu$ and draw conclusion
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/paste-5181F6DF.png)
:::
:::

-   $\mu = 390$, which is within (386.3, 413.7), we fail to reject $H_0$.

-   Thus, we support the statement that the population mean of the black bear weight is equal to 390.

## Three ways to do hypothesis test

### A. compare p-value and $\alpha$

-   $p-value \ge \alpha$: fail to reject $H_0$

-   $p-value < \alpha$: reject $H_0$

### B. compare statistical value vs critical value

-   $t_{statistics} < t_{criticle}$: fail to reject $H_0$

-   $t_{statistics} \ge t_{criticle}$: reject $H_0$

### C. compare confidence interval

-   If the confidence interval covers $\mu$: fail to reject $H_0$

-   Otherwise: reject $H_0$

## One-tailed or two-tailed test?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### How to tell

-   Based on the research question

-   If the $H_0$ is written with $=$, then it's a two-tailed test

-   If the $H_0$ is written with $>$ or $<$, then it's a one-tailed test

### So what

-   This would influence how you look up your p-value
:::

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:862/1*VXxdieFiYCgR6v7nUaq01g.jpeg)
:::
:::

-   Two-tailed test, when looking up the p-value, the probability needs to multiply by 2.

-   Two-tailed test, when looking up the $t_{critical}$, the probability is $\alpha/2$.

## **Gum thickness:** a two-tailed t-test

### The story

A manufacturer claims that the thickness of the spearmint gum it produces is 7.5 one-hundredths.

. . .

A quality control specialist regularly checks this claim. On one production run, he took a random sample of *n* = 10 pieces of gum and measured their thickness.

. . .

He obtained:

![](images/paste-9A58F1C5.png)

. . .

$$
n = 10, \bar{x} = 7.55, s = 0.1027, \alpha = 0.05
$$

Base on this sample, is the claim from the manufacturer valid?

## **Gum thickness**

### To solve this

. . .

### 1. Set up $H_0$ and $H_a$

-   $H_0:\mu = 7.5$: the mean of the spearmint gum thickness equals 7.5

-   $H_a: \mu \neq 7.5$, the mean of the spearmint gum thickness doesn't equal 7.5

### 2. Determine statistical significance level $\alpha$

-   We set the significance level $\alpha$ as 0.05

### 3. Calculate the test statistics

-   We are using t-statistics (because $n$ is small)

-   $t_{statistics} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{7.55 - 7.5}{0.1027/\sqrt{10}} = 1.54$

## **Gum thickness**

### To solve this

### 4. Find the p-value for test statistics

-   Using t-table, or R, or [online calculator](https://www.socscistatistics.com/pvalues/tdistribution.aspx)

-   Find the p-value for $t_{statistics} = 1.54$

    -   $df = n-1 = 9$

    -   **two-tailed**

-   $p-value = 0.158$

### 5. Compare $\alpha$ and p-value and draw conclusion

-   $p-value > \alpha$, we fail to reject $H_0$.

-   Thus, we support the statement that the mean of the spearmint gum thickness equals 7.5.

## **Gum thickness**

### Can you try the CI method?

$$
n = 10, \bar{x} = 7.55, s = 0.1027, \alpha = 0.05
$$

$$
CI = \bar{x} \pm t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}, n-1} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
CI = 7.55 \pm 2.262 * \frac{0.1027}{\sqrt{10}} = (7.476, 7.623)
$$

## What we learned

-   We can list null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis for research questions
-   We set the confidence level $\alpha$ that we want to test to get the "rules" about when to reject $H_0$.
-   We learned 5 steps of conducting a hypothesis test
-   And there are 3 variations
