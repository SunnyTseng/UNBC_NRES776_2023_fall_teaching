### Description

This project will make up 15% of your total grade. Base on a research
dataset, you will draft a research proposal with research title,
background, hypothesis, methods, and expected outcome. Make this project
as a research proposal that you are going to apply funding with. There
will be a 5-minutes presentation component as well as a 2-pages report.

### Guidelines

You could consider including one or more of the following analyses in
your report:

- Data visualization
- Descriptive statistics
- Comparison of means
- Correlation

And you could consider one of the following as proposed research methods
(we will cover these techniques in lectures):

- Multiple regression
- Generalized linear models
- Mixed-effect models
- Multivariate analyses
