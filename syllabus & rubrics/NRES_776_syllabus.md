This course provides advanced, practical training in the analysis of
quantitative data. The course focuses primarily on advanced univariate
statistics that can be applied to both experimental and observational
data. This focus includes a full exploration of generalized linear
models, including linear, logistic, and mixed models. Students also
receive instruction in the principles of experimental design, data
management, and the review and reporting of statistical results. Labs
focus on using R statistical software to manipulate, display, and
analyze data.

mental health and neurological disabilities, and mobility and other
physical disabilities. ARC staff are available by appointment to assess
specific needs, provide referrals, and arrange appropriate academic
accommodations to assist students in achieving their academic goals.
Students who may have a need for academic accommodation are encouraged
to contact ARC by email at <arc@unbc.ca>, by phone at 250-960-5682 (toll

### Academic dishonesty

University regulations strictly forbid academic dishonesty of any type,
including plagiarism, cheating during exams, or misrepresenting the
nature of your involvement in any assigned work. Students involved in
such acts may receive an automatic F in the course. Please consult the
“Regulations and Policies” section of the UNBC Undergraduate Calendar if
you are unfamiliar with definitions of any of the Academic Offences.
Note that ignorance of these policies will not be accepted as a defense.
Students guilty of such activities may receive a zero on the particular
assignment/exam/lab in question. If deemed sufficiently severe by the
instructor, the offense could lead to sanctions that include reprimand,
reduction of grade, or suspension. All matters of Academic Misconduct at
UNBC require instructors to submit a formal report to the Chair and
Office of Registrar, which will be placed in the student’s academic
file.
