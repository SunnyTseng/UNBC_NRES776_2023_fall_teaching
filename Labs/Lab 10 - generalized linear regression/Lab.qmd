# Lab 10 - GLM with multiple predictors

## A mini review for additive vs interaction

-   Response variable: `flipper_length_mm`

-   Predictor variable: `body_mass_g`, `species`

```{r, echo = TRUE}
my_data <- penguins %>%
  select(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, species) %>%
  drop_na()

my_data
```

## If there is only one predictor 

$$
FL_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Mass_{i}
$$

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm), data = my_data) +
  geom_point()
```

## Additive effect 

$$
FL_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Mass_{i} + \beta_2 SP_{1i} + \beta_3 SP_{2i}
$$

```{r, echo = TRUE}
lm_1 <- lm(formula = flipper_length_mm ~ body_mass_g + species,
           data = my_data)

summary(lm_1)
```

## Additive effect 

For species Adelie:

$$
FL_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Mass_{i} 
$$

For species Chinstrap:

$$
FL_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Mass_{i} + \beta_2
$$

For species Gentoo:
$$
FL_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Mass_{i} + \beta_3
$$

-   All three equations have the same slope! That is, $\beta_1$!

-   They only have different intercepts!

## Additive effect

-   Parallel lines!

```{r, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, group = species), data = my_data) +
     geom_point() +
     geom_line(aes(y = predict(lm_1)), size = 1)
```

## Interaction effect 

$$ FL_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Mass_{i} + \beta_2 SP_{1i} + \beta_3 SP_{2i} + \beta_{12}Mass_i*SP_{1i} + \beta_{13}Mass_{i}*SP_{2i} $$

```{r}
lm_2 <- lm(formula = flipper_length_mm ~ body_mass_g * species,
           data = my_data)

summary(lm_2)
```

## Interaction effect 

For species Adelie:

$$ FL_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Mass_{i}$$

For species Chinstrip:

$$ FL_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Mass_{i} + \beta_2 + \beta_{12}Mass_i $$

For species Gentoo:

$$ FL_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Mass_{i} + \beta_3 +  \beta_{13}Mass_{i} $$

-   All three equations have different slopes!

-   They only have different intercepts!

## Interaction effect 

-   Non parallel lines modelling

```{r, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, group = species), data = my_data) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Get the lab assignment file

1.  Download the files by clicking the link on Moodle `Lab 10 - assignment file`.
2.  Save everything in the same folder.
3.  Open the `R project` file, which should open a RStudio for you. From there, open the `.Rmd` file.
4.  Click `knit` and you should get a `html` output
5.  You are all set!

## Submission

### Due next Wednesday 23:59 pm, Moodle

-   File name and type (NRES776\_*firstname*\_*lastname*\_lab_10.**html**)

## Thank you everyone :)

-   This is the first time in my life teaching a course.

-   I had a LOT of fun this semester. And I learned SO much! I hope you did as well!

-   And I know I haven't finished marking project 1 yet... I am on my way!
