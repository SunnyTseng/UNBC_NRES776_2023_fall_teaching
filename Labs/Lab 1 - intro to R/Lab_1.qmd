# Welcome to your first R lab!

## Our schedule today

-   Discussion paper presentation (30 min)

-   Lab intro (10 min)

-   Intro to R, R studio, and gentle intro to programming (60 min)

-   Quiet time for practice (60 min)

## About these labs

### Consider keeping your video on

-   Ultimately, you need to be comfortable (and you have the right to privacy)

### Format

-   I will provide you tools and workflow to get started with R

-   I will go over specific functions (how to run and interpret)

-   We will have demonstration, hands-on, and free time

### R is hard: But we have no fear

-   Don't expect to remember everything

-   Copy/Paste is your friend

-   Feel free to interrupt me

## What is R?

> A programming **language**, a way to give instructions in order to get a computer to do something

-   We will learn together how to speak the language (i.e., writing the code)

-   Computers can only read your code, but not your mind

-   Spelling, punctuation, space, capitalization matter!

### For example

R, what is 78 times 87?

```{r, echo = TRUE}

78 * 87
```

## Why R?

R is hard

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#| warning: false

library(seewave)
library(tuneR)

dir <- "E:/Audio/2021_passerine"
dataset <- read_csv(here("Ch1_BirdNET", "data", "2021_MacGillivray's Warbler_working.csv"))


for (i in 101:180) {
  site <- dataset$site[i]
  recording <- dataset$recording[i]
  start_s <- dataset$start_s[i]
  end_s <- dataset$end_s[i]
  
  
  song <- readWave(paste0(dir, "/", site, "/", recording, ".wav"), 
                   from = start_s - 1, 
                   to = end_s + 1, 
                   units = "seconds")
  
  print(paste0("This is recording ", recording, " from ", start_s, " to ", end_s))
  play(song, ... = "/play /close")
}
```

## Why R?

R is hard - but powerful

## Why R?

R is hard - but beautiful

## Why R?

R is hard - but reproducible

## Why R?

R is hard - but free

-   A lot of observations

-   I used R Quarto to make the slides

## What is R?

## What is R Studio?

-   R Studio is not R, RStudio is a Graphic User Interfaces (GUI)

-   You can only use R console to program, but RStudio makes your life easier

-   Think it as a

## Let's get started with RStudio!

## Your first R code!
