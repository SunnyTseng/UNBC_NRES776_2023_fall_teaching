# Welcome to your second R lab!

## Our schedule today

-   Announcements (5 min)

-   Discussion paper presentation (35 mins)

-   Importing data in R (20 min)

-   Data visualization with R (60 min)

-   Quiet time for practice (60 min)

# Discussion paper presentation

-   Student names

# Import (read) and Export (write) Data

With various packages

## Concept of working directory

> You have to tell R **where** to find your data

-   use read_csv() as an example, we need to specify the path

-   where are you now? and where is your data?

-   absolute path vs relative path

## R project

-   We have done this, but what this for?

<!-- -->

-   output .Rproj in a folder, for reading data

-   set up fires in computer

## R project step by step

## Be a good project manager

-   Create a project

-   Create folder structure

-   Save your R script and R project in the root

-   Only need to read using "docs/my_data.csv"

-   Try this for you lab

-   Try this for your research project/chapter

## Read excel files

## Read CSVs

## Read TSVs or TXTs

## Write CSVs

# Data Visualization

With `ggplot2` and `patchwork` package

Using `palmerpenguins` as example

## wow `ggplot()`! 

## Plots are created in layers

## Piece by piece

## Create a canvas: `ggplot()`

## Plot type: `geom_()`

## Theme

## Customized theme

## Selection of colours

## Put figures together 

## Export figure

-   By RStudio

-   By save_image into different types

# R Others: Miscellaneous

Here is some advanced materials if you are comfortable and familiar with the content above

## Improving code readability

### Space

Use space like you would in speaking

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
a <- mean(c(4, 10, 13))
```

This is easier to read than

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
a<-mean(c(4,10,13))

```

## Improving code readability

### Line breaks

Don't be afraid to break the lines. Do you like this?

```{r, echo= TRUE, eval = FALSE}
a <- tibble(exp = c("A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "B"),
            sub = c("A1", "A1", "A2", "A2", "A3", "A3"),
            res = c(10, 12, 45, 12, 12, 13))

```

Or this?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
a <- tibble(exp = c("A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "B"), sub = c("A1", "A1", "A2", "A2", "A3", "A3"), res = c(10, 12, 45, 12, 12, 13))

```

# Lab assignment

## Your task I

Using penguins data set

-   Create a histogram to show

-   Create a bar plot to show

-   Create a scatter plot to show

-   Create a box plot to show

Use patchwork to combine four figures together (two up, two down)

Bonus: Create one more figure from your own with a caption (what you try to convey) for it. Add it as the fifth plots in your patchwork

### Hints

1.  use `geom_hist()`
2.  use `geom_bar()`
3.  use `geom_scatter()`
4.  use `geom_box()`

## Submission

### Due next Wednesday 23:59 pm, Moodle

### Evaluation

-   File name and type (NRES776\_*firstname*\_*lastname*\_lab_2.png) (20%)

-   Quality of the figures (check lecture notes for data visualization background) (20%, 20%, 20%, 20%)

-   Bonus points for extra question, and general design of the figure layout (30%)

### Use of ChatGPT, stackflow, or...

-   Copy/Paste is your friend! (and never apologize for it!) 😍

-   But be sure you understand **why** the codes are doing what they are doing 🧑‍🎓

-   So that you form some new neuron connections in the brain 🧠

## Quiet/Noisy room
